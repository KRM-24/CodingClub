Repository for misc web concepts

My first README file!

I hope to use this GitHub repository to allow students to collaborate with me in making a simple HTML + Javascript (JS) game. And also to provide an example of source control/branching/merging/committing.

And to have fun! Fun is important too! :)

Ok, bye.
